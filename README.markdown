### Simple Vue.js List

For this exercise, you will need to build a simple Vue.js app to list the
given quotes. Please do not use any libraries or plugins to do this other
than the core [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/) and, optionally, a library to fetch
the quotes.

You can assume that you only need to support modern web browsers, so feel
free to build the app using either the new ECMAScript 6 or the older ECMAScript 5
("plain" JavaScript) standard.

Please provide the following functionality:

 * Required: Fetch quotes from the source [quotes.json](https://gist.githubusercontent.com/benchprep/dffc3bffa9704626aa8832a3b4de5b27/raw/quotes.json) and display the available information in a list-like structure (table/list)
 * Required: Provide client-side pagination (up to 15 quotes per page)
 * Required: Provide a way to filter between game and movie quotes
 * Required: Provide a client-side search that filters by the quote text

## Ruby

The find method accepts a string of lower case letters. Find should return an array of all the words in dictionary.json that can be made by rearranging these letters. Feel free to add whatever you need to make the class work accurately and efficiently.

To the run the provided tests:

```
ruby word_finder_test.rb
```

Feel free to add any tests you wish or to use a different test libary like rspec.
